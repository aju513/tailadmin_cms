# Testing and Operations

## Local verification

Run `npm run build` once before feature tests so both admin and frontend manifests exist. See [folder-structure.md](folder-structure.md) for separate build/development commands.

```bash
php artisan test
vendor/bin/pint --test
npm run build
php artisan route:list
```

Feature tests use SQLite in memory and database refresh. Test role/permission behavior through public routes or services; do not rely solely on package internals.

## Deployment

```bash
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
npm ci && npm run build
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan admin:permissions-sync
php artisan admin:menu-regenerate
php artisan optimize
```

Configure a real mail transport before relying on forgot-password. Change the bootstrap password immediately and do not expose an installation with the known credential; password changes are not forced by middleware. The scheduler must run every minute so the daily activity cleanup executes.

Permission synchronization is exact and may delete obsolete database permissions. Review configuration changes before production deployment and deploy permission/menu changes together.

## Frontend operations

Rebuild assets for the new public Vite entries after deploying this change. Apply the publication-index migration and verify APP_URL and the public storage link. Use frontend:images-optimize for existing media and frontend:cache-clear after external database writes. See [frontend.md](frontend.md) for commands and production performance checks.
